  "description": "Blender 2.9 to 2.93 is significantly outdated and should generally be avoided. Though the offical cats discord server may provide support still, We recommend you still upgrade to a newer version of Blender. However, if for some specific reason you require this version, we have provided a link to the last known working build compatible with these Blender versions. We strongly recommend upgrading to a newer version of Blender unless you have a compelling reason to use these versions.",
