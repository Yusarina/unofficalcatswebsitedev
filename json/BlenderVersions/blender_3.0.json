  "description": "Blender 3.0 is the first version of Blender where we recommend using the development (dev) version of the Cats add-on due to several issues found in the main branch when used with Blender 3.0 and above. However, we still recommend upgrading to at least Blender 3.1, as Blender 3.0 is in a peculiar middle ground where both the dev version and the master branch of the Cats add-on cause issues. If you need support, you should be able to find assistance on the official Cats add-on Discord server.",
