  "description": "For Blender 4.1, we recommend using the unofficial Cats add-on instead of the official version. The official Cats add-on hasn't been updated to support the API changes introduced in Blender 4.x, and its bundled MMD Tools remain outdated. However, please note that the unofficial Cats add-on for Blender 4.0 has reached its End-of-Life (EOL) status and will no longer receive updates. For Blender 4.x versions, we recommend using the unofficial Cats add-on for Blender 4.2+, which is still actively maintained. Due to the EOL status of the Blender 4.0 version, no support will be provided, and the Discord link has been removed. Please refrain from asking for help with the unofficial version in the official Cats Discord server.",
