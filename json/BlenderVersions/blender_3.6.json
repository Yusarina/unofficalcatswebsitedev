  "description": "Blender 3.6 LTS offers two support options. The first is the unofficial Cats add-on for Blender 3.6, which is currently supported and includes several fixes not present in the official version. The second option is the official Cats add-on for Blender 3.6. It's important to note that you should not ask for help with the unofficial version in the official Cats Discord server, as no support will be provided there, and vice versa for the official version in the unofficial Discord.",
