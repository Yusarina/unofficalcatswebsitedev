  "description": "Blender versions 2.8 to 2.83 are significantly outdated and should generally be avoided. While the official Cats Discord server may still provide support, we recommend upgrading to a newer version of Blender. If you have a specific reason to use these versions, we've provided a link to the last known working build compatible with Blender 2.8 to 2.83. We strongly advise upgrading to a newer version of Blender unless you have a compelling reason to use these older versions.",
