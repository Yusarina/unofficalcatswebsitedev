            "answer": "[warning]Important: Since Blender 4.1, decimation has been removed from Cats due to performance issues. For Blender 4.1+ users, please use [link]https://github.com/feilen/tuxedo-blender-plugin|Tuxedo[/link] which offers superior decimation functionality.[/warning]\n\nCats offers several decimation options for older Blender versions:\n\n[details]Save Decimation|Safely decimates only meshes without shape keys.[/details]\n\n[details]Half Decimation|Decimates meshes with less than 4 shape keys (typically non-essential ones).[/details]\n\n[details]Full Decimation|Decimates the entire model, removing all shape keys in the process.[/details]\n\n[details]Custom Decimation|Allows manual selection of meshes and shape keys to preserve during decimation.[/details]",

            "question": "Common Decimation Issues and Solutions",
            "answer": "[info]Here are the most common decimation issues and their solutions:[/info]\n\n[details]Combined Meshes|Q: Why does decimation combine all meshes?\nA: This is intended behavior. For individual object decimation, use Blender's built-in tools instead.[/details]\n\n[details]Broken Shape Keys|Q: Why aren't my visemes/shape keys working properly?\nA: Decimation can break shape keys. Use Blender's native tools:\n- Enter Edit Mode\n- Press X for the deletion menu\n- Try options like dissolve edges/vertices or limited dissolve\n- Alternatively, use Mesh > Clean Up > Decimate Geometry[/details]\n\n[details]Poor Results|Q: My avatar looks bad after decimation\nA: You likely over-decimated the model. Try:\n1. Using a higher decimation ratio\n2. Using Blender's native tools for more control\n3. Using [link]https://github.com/feilen/tuxedo-blender-plugin|Tuxedo Plugin[/link] for smart decimation[/details]\n\n[warning]Lost Shape Keys Warning|If you've lost shape keys after decimation, this is expected behavior. The tool clearly states it will remove shape keys. For shape key-preserving decimation:\n1. Use Blender's built-in tools\n2. Try the Tuxedo plugin\n3. Use Custom Decimation with careful selection[/warning]\n\n[note]Professional Recommendation: While Cats decimation is suitable for basic needs, learning Blender's native tools or using Tuxedo plugin is highly recommended for better results and more control.[/note]",
