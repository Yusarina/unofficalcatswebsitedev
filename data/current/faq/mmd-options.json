            "question": "How do I use the MMD Options Panel?",
            "answer": "[warning]The MMD Options panel is specifically designed for MMD, VRM, and GMod models. While it may work with other model types, it will likely cause issues with non-supported armature structures. The Fix Model system is not a universal one-click solution and was never intended as such. Note that Rigify armatures are not compatible with these tools.[/warning]\n\n### MMD Options Overview\nThe MMD Options panel provides specialized tools for handling MMD (MikuMikuDance) models, converting them for use in other 3D platforms while maintaining model integrity.\n\n[image]https://cdn.neoneko.xyz/catsblenderplugin/website/wikicurrent/mmd-options1.png[/image]\n\n### Fix Model Section\n**Fix Armature Button**\n- Comprehensive armature optimization\n- Removes MMD-specific unused bones\n- Fixes hierarchy issues\n- Optimizes weight distributions\n- Maintains animation compatibility\n\n**Model Settings (Advanced Options)**\n- Keep End Bones: \n  - Preserves bones at hierarchy endpoints\n  - Important for certain animations\n  - Maintains model structure integrity\n\n- Keep Upper Chest: \n  - Retains upper chest bone movement\n  - Essential for detailed upper body animations\n  - Preserves breathing animations\n\n- Keep/Fix Twist Bones:\n  - Maintains smooth limb deformations\n  - Optimizes twist bone behavior\n  - Improves animation quality\n\n- Join Meshes:\n  - Combines separate mesh parts\n  - Optimizes model topology\n  - Reduces draw calls\n\n- Connect Bones:\n  - Creates visual bone connections\n  - Improves armature visualization\n  - Helps with weight painting\n\n- Remove Zero Weight:\n  - Cleans vertex groups without influence\n  - Optimizes mesh data\n  - Reduces file size\n\n- Remove Rigidbodies/Joints:\n  - Removes MMD physics components\n  - Prepares model for other platforms\n  - Cleans up unnecessary constraints\n\n### Material Operations\n**Combine Materials Button**\n- Smart material merging system\n- Preserves texture properties\n- Optimizes render calls\n- Maintains material effects\n- Improves performance\n\n**Material Fix Information**\n- Explains material conversion process\n- Details texture handling\n- Guides through optimization steps\n\n**Fix Materials Button**\n- Converts MMD-specific materials\n- Fixes texture references\n- Ensures shader compatibility\n- Optimizes material settings\n- Prepares for platform-specific use\n\n### Rigidbodies Section\n**Remove Rigidbodies and Joints**\n- Manual cleanup of physics components\n- Removes:\n  - MMD rigid bodies\n  - Physics joints\n  - Dynamic bone settings\n  - Unused constraints\n- Optimizes model for static use\n- Prepares for custom physics systems\n\n### Best Practices\n1. Always start with Fix Armature\n2. Review model settings before applying\n3. Handle materials after armature fixes\n4. Clean up physics components last\n5. Test animations after each major change\n\n[note]The order of operations matters. Following the panel's layout from top to bottom ensures the most effective optimization process.[/note]\n\n[warning]These tools make permanent changes to your model's structure. Create a backup of your original MMD model before starting the optimization process.[/warning]",
