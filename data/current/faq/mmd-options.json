Materials should be set up directly in Unity instead of embedding them in the FBX file. Embedded materials increase file size and memory usage in both Unity and VRChat, which is not recommended for performance optimization. The previous material fixes were specific to older VRChat requirements and are no longer necessary for current workflows.\n- Combine Materials\n- Remove Rigid Bodies and Joints",
