            "question": "How do I install Cats Blender Plugin?",
            "answer": "Before you begin: Get the correct version of Cats for your Blender version using our [version selector](https://catsblenderplugin.xyz).\n\nThese instructions are for Blender 4.2 and above. For Blender 4.1 and older, see our [legacy installation guide](https://catsblenderplugin.xyz/wiki.html?version=legacy#how-do-i-install-cats-blender-plugin-blender-36-and-older)\n\n[warning]If you have previously attempted to install any version of Cats, please restart Blender before installing the new version to ensure a clean installation.[/warning]\n\n[warning]Important: Some users with the Steam or Microsoft Store versions of Blender have reported plugin installation issues. If you encounter problems, we recommend downloading Blender directly from blender.org instead.[/warning]\n\n### Installing via Blender's Extension System\n[image]https://cdn.neoneko.xyz/catsblenderplugin/website/wikicurrent/install1.png[/image]\n\n1.
