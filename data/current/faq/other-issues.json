Issues reported for outdated versions will be closed unless verified as legitimate updater problems.[/warning]\n\n[note]If the updater suggests a version for a different Blender version, you likely have an old plugin version. Please manually update to the correct version for your Blender installation.[/note]",

While CATS remains fully functional, its method of loading third-party addons triggers these new policy warnings.",

            "question": "What is the current status of the Official Cats Blender Plugin?",
            "answer": "### Current Status\nAs of August 2024, the Official Cats Blender Plugin appears to be in an indefinite hiatus. Here's the timeline:\n\n- Last Official Release: June 27, 2021\n- Last Main Branch Update: January 25, 2022\n- Last Development Branch Updates:\n  - November 30, 2023 (minor fix)\n  - April 8, 2023 (version bump)\n\n### Official Statement (April 5, 2023)\nThe last official update provided the following information:\n\n- No estimated timeline for official updates\n- Project ownership limitations prevent community updates\n- Community developers can't publish official releases\n- Negotiations were ongoing for transfer of release permissions\n\n[note]While the last update mentioned ongoing negotiations, this information is now outdated. Neoneko has made multiple attempts to contact the original project developers to take over the Official discord and update the Github, all without success. The original project is 100% abandoned.\n\nNeoneko's Statement (26/09/2024):\n\"At this point, it's safe to say that it's 100% been abandoned. Absolute Quantum (who goes by several different names) and Hotox are not active anywhere in the CATS community and haven't been for a very long time. I have recently tried to contact the main developer to see if we could take over the official CATS GitHub repository, but to no avail. At this point, I believe the main original developer has 100% vanished from the internet.\"\n\nAdditionally, Neoneko spent over 6 months working with Patreon's safety team to have the original Cats Patreon page taken down, as the original developers were still receiving money from users unaware of the project's abandoned status. After persistent communication with Patreon's safety team, the page was successfully removed to prevent further misleading of users.[/note]\n\n### What This Means For Users\n- Official Cats Plugin users will no longer receive:\n  - Updates for new Blender versions\n  - Bug fixes or improvements\n  - New feature additions\n- Unofficial Cats Plugin users will receive:\n  - Regular updates for latest Blender versions\n  - Active bug fixes and improvements\n  - New features and enhancements\n  - Ongoing community support\n\n### How To Help The Community\n1. Comment on YouTube tutorials and guides:\n   - Let viewers know the video uses outdated Cats Plugin\n   - Share the link to Unofficial Cats Plugin\n   - Mention that Unofficial Cats supports latest Blender versions\n2. Engage with community platforms:\n   - Update outdated forum posts\n   - Share success stories with Unofficial Cats\n   - Help redirect users to current documentation\n3. Spread awareness on social media:\n   - Share updates about Unofficial Cats\n   - Create new tutorials using current versions\n   - Join community discussions\n\n[warning]Be cautious of outdated tutorials suggesting manual fixes or code modifications. The \"Testing\" error in Blender 3.0+ is not a code issue - it indicates you're using an incompatible Cats version. Visit https://catsblenderplugin.xyz and use our version selector to get the correct version for your Blender installation. Many content creators incorrectly suggest removing \"Testing\" from the code, contradicting official guidance from both the Cats Discord and Neoneko team. Following these incorrect fixes will leave you with an outdated, unsupported version of Cats that lacks crucial updates and creates additional compatibility problems with Blender 3.0+.[/warning]\n\n[note]The Unofficial Cats Plugin continues to be developed and maintained by the community to ensure ongoing compatibility and support.[/note]",
