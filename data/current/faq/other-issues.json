            "answer": "### Common Update Checker Issues\n\n**Using Outdated Plugin:**\n- Blender 4.2: Should report version 4.2.x.x\n- Older versions reporting 0.50.0 or 3.6.4 need updating\n\n**Version Number Format:**\n- Current format: 4.2.x.x (e.g., 4.2.1.0)\n- Old format: 0.50.0, 3.6.4 (without final digit)\n\n**VPN Issues:**\n- Some VPN providers may interfere with the version checker\n\n[warning]If using versions before 3.6.4.1 or 4.2.2.1, update your plugin first. Issues reported for outdated versions will be closed unless verified as legitimate updater problems.[/warning]\n\n[note]If the updater suggests a version for a different Blender version, you likely have an old plugin version. Please manually update to the correct version for your Blender installation.[/note]",

While CATS remains fully functional, its method of loading third-party addons triggers these new policy warnings.",
