            "answer": "### Atlas Tab Overview\nThe Atlas tab helps you combine multiple textures into a single texture atlas, reducing draw calls and improving avatar performance.\n\n[image]https://cdn.neoneko.xyz/catsblenderplugin/website/wikicurrent/optimzation1.png[/image]\n\n### Important Notes\n- For PBR/Normal maps, use Tuxedo Blender Plugin instead\n- Atlas creation can significantly reduce your avatar's resource usage\n- Helps stay within platform texture limits\n\n### Material Combiner Features\n**Combining Multiple Materials**\n- Mix diffuse colors with textures\n- Specify atlas size and individual texture sizes\n- Optimize texture layout automatically\n\n### How To Use Material Combiner\n   - Check/uncheck boxes to include/exclude materials\n   - Use Select All/Deselect All for quick selection\n5. Set size for materials without images (default: 32px)\n6. Click 'Save atlas to..' to start the process\n\n[note]If materials don't merge properly or textures are missing from the atlas, check the [link]https://github.com/Grim-es/material-combiner-addon/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#after-clicking-save-atlas-to-the-materials-are-simply-merged-or-the-atlas-image-does-not-have-all-the-textures|troubleshooting guide[/link].[/note]\n\n### Integration States\nThe Atlas tab shows different options based on SMC status:\n\n**When SMC is not installed:**\n- Shows clear installation steps\n- Provides direct download link to get SMC\n- Explains why SMC is needed for atlas creation\n\n**When SMC is disabled:**\n- Quick enable button to activate SMC\n- No restart required\n- Instant access to atlas tools after enabling\n\n**When SMC is outdated:**\n- Version compatibility information\n- Direct link to get the compatible version\n- Explains which features need updating\n\n**When SMC is properly installed:**\n- Full access to texture atlas creation\n- Material combining options\n- Advanced texture packing settings\n\nFor more detailed information about Material Combiner, visit their [link]https://github.com/Grim-es/material-combiner-addon|Github repository[/link].\n\n### Benefits of Using Atlas\n- Reduces draw calls significantly\n- Improves avatar performance\n- Helps meet platform limitations\n- Simplifies material management",
