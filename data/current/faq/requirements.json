            "answer": "### Required Software\n- Blender 4.2 LTS and above\n  - Blender 4.2 LTS is the current recommended version\n- Python package requirements:\n  - If you have custom Python installed which Blender might use, you need to have Numpy installed\n\n[warning]Windows Store Users\nThough Cats seems to work on Windows Store these days, no support will be given if there are any issues. The Unofficial Cats does not support Windows Store due to issues Windows Store versions of Blender have given in the past.[/warning]\n\n[note]Steam Users\nSome Steam users have reported issues that were resolved by downloading Blender directly from blender.org instead. If you experience problems with the Steam version, please try using the official download from the Blender website.[/note]\n\n### Recommended Setup\n- Download Blender directly from [link]https://www.blender.org/download/|blender.org[/link]\n- Use the LTS (Long Term Support) version for best stability",
