  "description": "Blender 2.79 is significantly outdated and should generally be avoided. The official Cats project no longer supports this version and hasn't for a considerable time. However, if you have a specific reason to use this version, we've provided a link to the last known working build compatible with Blender 2.79. Please note that neither the official nor unofficial teams support this version, and we strongly recommend upgrading to a newer version of Blender. There is no wiki or support for this version, even on the Official Cats Discord, so you'll be on your own.",
